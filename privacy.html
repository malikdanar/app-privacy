            </p>
            <p>
                MahjKo-ko Royale is a casual mobile game. This Privacy Policy describes what information we do and do not collect,
                how it may be used, and what choices you have.
                By installing or playing MahjKo-ko Royale, you agree to the practices described here.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>1. Information we do not collect</h2>
            <p>
                MahjKo-ko Royale is designed to be simple and lightweight. The game:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>does not require you to create an account or log in,</li>
                <li>does not ask you to provide your name, email, phone number, or address,</li>
                <li>does not request access to your contacts, photos, microphone, or precise location.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We do not knowingly collect any information that directly identifies you as an individual.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Game progress and local storage</h2>
            <p>
                The game may store basic progress information locally on your device,
                such as completed levels, simple settings, and preferences (for example, language or visual options).
                This information is stored only on your device’s local storage
                and is used solely so the game can remember your progress and settings between sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can usually clear this data by deleting the app or using your device’s application data settings.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Analytics and third-party services</h2>
            <p>
                At the moment, MahjKo-ko Royale does not intentionally integrate third-party analytics,
                advertising SDKs, or tracking tools within the game itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the app may be distributed through third-party platforms such as the Apple App Store
                or Google Play. These platforms may collect their own technical, usage, or diagnostic data in accordance
                with their own privacy policies. We do not control how these platforms handle such data.
                For more details, please review the privacy policies of the relevant store or platform.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Children’s privacy</h2>
            <p>
                MahjKo-ko Royale is intended for a general audience and is not specifically targeted at children.
                We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
                If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information by mistake,
                please contact us using the email address below and we will take steps to address the situation.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Data sharing</h2>
            <p>
                Since MahjKo-ko Royale does not collect personally identifiable information,
                there is no personal data to sell, rent, or trade with third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
                If this ever changes in a future version of the game (for example, if online features are added),
                this Privacy Policy will be updated to explain what is collected and how it is shared,
                and you will see the updated version in the app or on the store page.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Data security</h2>
            <p>
                We aim to keep MahjKo-ko Royale simple and to limit the data stored.
                Progress and settings are kept locally on your device.
                Please remember that no system is perfectly secure, and keeping your device and operating system
                up to date is an important part of protecting your information.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. International users</h2>
            <p>
                MahjKo-ko Royale may be downloaded and used in different countries and regions.
                Because the game itself does not collect personal data, there is no transfer of your personal
                information between countries by us. Any data collected by app stores or platform owners is handled under
                their own terms and policies.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>
                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example when we add new features or adjust
                how the game works. Any changes will be posted in the updated version of this page.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we make significant changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this document.
                Your continued use of MahjKo-ko Royale after any changes means you accept the updated Policy.
            </p>
        </section>
